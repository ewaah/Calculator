# Calculator
# Its my first self written calculator.
# To write the code i used Python 3.8. 

# V1.0: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root
#       (Has a bug in it which causes the break to not end the loop)

# V1.1: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root
#       (the break bug has been fixed and now works properly)
