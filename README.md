# Calculator
# Its my first self written calculator.
# To write the code i used Python 3.8. 

# V1.0: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root
#       (Has a bug in it which causes the break to not end the loop)

# V1.1: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root
#       (the break bug has been fixed and now works properly)

# V1.2: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root
#       (I took out the square root code and made it into a function, to make that work i had to rearrange some stuff.
#        im not sure if its completly bug free atm.)

# V1.2.1: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root
#       (I took out the square root code and made it into a function, to make that work i had to rearrange some stuff.
#        im not sure if its completly bug free atm. This version is also cleaned off unnessecary lines of code. it's almost half the lines #        of code compared to v1.0)
