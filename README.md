# Calculator
# Its my first self written calculator.
# To write the code i used Python 3.8. 

# V1.0: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root
#       (Has a bug in it which causes the break to not end the loop)

# V1.1: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root
#       (the break bug has been fixed and now works properly)

# V1.2: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root
#       (I took out the square root code and made it into a function, to make that work i had to rearrange some stuff.
#        im not sure if its completly bug free atm.)

# V1.2.1: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root
#       (I took out the square root code and made it into a function, to make that work i had to rearrange some stuff.
#        im not sure if its completly bug free atm. This version is also cleaned off unnessecary lines of code. it's almost half the lines #        of code compared to v1.0)

# V1.3: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root
#       (I rewrote alot of code to make it faster and cleaner. I also solved alot of bug that made the program crash before. like dividing #        by zero, using a negative number for squarroot. Or entering a higher number then the menu offered, sometimes the menu would not    #        reappear or an infinte loop triggered itself.)

# V1.4: Features
#       adding , devision, multiply, substract, square root, show pi
#       (Final release and works bug free atm. I added the option to show pi just as a last thing.)
